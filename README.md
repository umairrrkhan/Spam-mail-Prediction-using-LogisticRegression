# Spam-mail-Prediction-using-LogisticRegression
the Spam-mail-Prediction-using-LogisticRegression project! Our goal is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an email is spam or not based on its contents.

Spam emails can be a significant problem for individuals and businesses alike, and our project aims to provide an effective solution to this issue. We have utilized the power of logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm in machine learning, to build a predictive model for spam email detection.

We have preprocessed the data using techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, to convert the text into a more manageable format. We then trained our logistic regression model using Scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning. We evaluated the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure that it is reliable and effective.
